- Prefer semantic code search ("eSearch") to explore and understand code by meaning. Use it to answer "how/where/what" questions.
- Start broad (root scope) and then narrow to one directory when results cluster. Typical scopes:
  - `cube_generalization/`
  - `path_simulation/`
  - `cube_simulation/`
  - `ycb_simulation/`
- Issue one complete question per search. Avoid multi-part prompts; split into separate searches (e.g., auth flow vs. storage location).
- Run 2–4 complementary searches in parallel with varied phrasing; then re-run scoped to the most relevant directory or file.
- After locating candidates, open specific files to read only the necessary chunks. For very large files, search within the file instead of reading it entirely.
- Use exact-text search only when you know the identifier/string you need (e.g., class/function name, message string). Use filename search for locating files by name.
- Respect project boundaries and `.gitignore`. Avoid scanning large data files; do not read full `*.json` datasets unless required.
- When sharing findings, cite code with file path and line ranges; keep snippets minimal and focused.
- Do not use any parse, I always like to run the code by click the run button
- Do not sample code until I said so, always explain the theory first
- Do not add any error handelling method like try/catch until I said so
- Always generate at least two ideas, and debate with each other
- Always have a short summary of what I just asked
